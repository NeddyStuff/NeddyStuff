<h1>About</h1>
<span><p>Hello, I am Nedas K. And I do photography. On this website you are able to download some of my work for free. But if you want to get the raw photos from some of the packs I've shown, you'll have to donate to my Patreon which is linked on the main page. You'll then get all of my photos in raw format, including the .xmp. That means that you'll be able to load any of these photos in Photoshop and you'll see the finished project.</p>
